# README

This is Project 1, the second project for the Web Development Course at General Assembly.

Project 1 is a called heimat. It is a basic social media platform with the ideas from both Pinterest and Instagram.

Users can:
- become a member and sign up, sign in, sign out
- edit their profile picture and background/banner image,
- post an image with a title and comment,
- edit these images or delete them
- go to a page with other users and check out their profile page
- make comments on other users posts
- from the home page you can get links to topics of interest with more images

Gems used (besides the basic built-in):
- Ruby version 5.1.4
- bcrypt version 3.1.7
- jquery-rails
- bootstrap sass
- cloudinary
- pry-rails for development

To get done:
- the code is currently in a mess which will be fixed and cleaned,
- there are also a few bugs that needs to be fixed too such as the post image cannot be edited, etc,
- and definitely more needs to be done on the css on this project,
- the project also needs to be set up to be responsive with changes in sizes in the browser or mobile,
- add a search for searching users, post and topics of interest
- the topic of interest from home page link needs more added to it, links images etc
- for now, fixed the above and I'm sure more will be added to it later..
